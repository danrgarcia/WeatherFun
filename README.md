# WeatherFun
A Python script to pull weather data and analyze trends.

Another fun project practicing learning python 3. 
This time I tried to use experience in learning API's as well as Numpy and Pandas to analyze the data pulled.

Does require an environment variable called "API_KEY" from openweathermaps API.
